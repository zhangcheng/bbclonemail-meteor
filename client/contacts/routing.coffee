  # Router
  # ------

  # The contacts router handles the incoming routes from the browser url, from
  # bookmarks, direct links and users typing directly in to the url.
  #
  # The router callbacks are only fired when the url hash is
  # directly hit, either by bookmark or manually changing
  # the hash.
  #
  # Also note that the router is as dumb as possible. It only
  # calls out to other sub-app controlling objects, and lets
  # those objects do the real work.
  ContactsRouting.Router = Backbone.Marionette.AppRouter.extend
    appRoutes:
      contacts: "showContactList"

  # Show route for the contacts app
  BBCloneMail.vent.bind "contacts:show", ->
    BBCloneMail.Routing.showRoute "contacts"


  # Initialization
  # --------------

  # Initialize the router when the application starts
  BBCloneMail.addInitializer ->
    ContactsRouting.router = new ContactsRouting.Router(controller: BBCloneMail.ContactsApp)
